This project is currently in active development. Features, assets, and gameplay are subject to change. Expect bugs, incomplete systems, and ongoing improvements. Play at your own risk! An English introduction video is planned soon.

# ðŸ“– Game Overview
Star Blade is a thrilling third-person action game built in Unreal Engine 5. You play as a stranded explorer on the hostile alien planet Zorath, battling endless waves of mutated alien creatures spawned via an advanced procedural enemy generation system while fleeing and completing dynamic quests to survive.
Navigate crumbling ruins, tackle mission objectivesâ€”like hacking ancient terminals or collecting resourcesâ€”to trigger key events and unlock the signal flare. Your ultimate goal: successfully launch a signal flare to summon a rescue helicopter and escape amid enemy chaos.
Core Loop:

Run & Gun: Dash toward objectives while auto-spawning enemies ambush you from all sides.

Skill Mastery: Master three unique skills (each with individual cooldowns) + basic attacks to clear hordes.


Skill 1: Slash with a Knife (single-target high-damage strike).

Skill 2: Slash with Three Knives (multi-target tracking strike).

Skill 3: Shoot a Massive Fireball (area explosion with burn effect).



Quest-Driven Progression: Tasks unlock story beats, upgrades, and the final helicopter rescue.

Currently, there are no cinematic sequences, focusing on core gameplay, with a playtime of approximately 20 minutes (single-player mode).
Coming Soon: Full release with polish, achievements, and additional content.
